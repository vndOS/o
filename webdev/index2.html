          <p>Web development is the process of building and maintaining websites to host via the internet. The process involves tasks such as web designing, client-side and server-side scripting, web content development, and network security configuration to build a perfect website or web application. Web design and web development are two most confused and interchangeably used terms, however, they are not the same.</p>

          <p>While web design focuses on aesthetics, design, layout, and user experience of the website, web development involves the usage of web languages, software, and coding to make the website functional. Web development is about experimenting with new technologies, solving customers’ problems, and building a responsive, easily accessible, and useful websites.</p>

		  <h1>Why Is Web Development Needed?</h1>
          <p>Websites have become the first point of communication between customers and brands lately. It helps in creating awareness about a brand and its products and services, it generates leads, and it facilitates buying and selling of products. Websites give customers more liberty to choose, buy, and pay for a product as per their requirements, from anywhere, 24×7.</p>

			<h1></h1>
          <p><small>Similarly, a well optimised, partially automated website, helps businesses hire employees only for the essential tasks rather than just assisting customers in selecting, buying, paying, or returning products like they do in physical stores. Had web development not been there, businesses could not have built their remarkable identity standing strong in today’s cut-throat competition.
		  
		  Web development helps organisations expand their reach through a credible platform, reduce costs, provide 24×7 accessibility to the customers, and pave the way for affordable worldwide marketing. </small></p>

			<h1>When Do Organisations Need Web Developers?</h1>
          <p><small>Organisations are established to detect customers’ problems and solve them. After detection of the problem, companies find and build a solution that reaches the customers through a website. While anyone can create a website today with free-of-cost page builders and templates, only a skilled, technically sound, visually creative, and experienced web developer can make a customised website as per companies’ requirements.</small></p>
